## About

The Original project was made by [@Pones2](https://www.github.com/Pones2) and me, for the Archives Processing class. This repository is for improving the application and refactoring the code.

The program consists of a series of functions to manipulate archives, implementing some basic functionality of a DBMS. Everything was built from scratch using `C`.

## Current State

Currently, I'm working on translating the code and project description to English, and making sure everything that is already implemented is working. It is still a work in progress.
